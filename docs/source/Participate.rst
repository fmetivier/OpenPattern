Participate
===========

Add patterns
------------

The easiest way to participate is to embed patterns in the
library. Just take inspiration from how
existing patterns where drafted to write the code. It's important to
reference the origin of the pattern (is it a published pattern or is it
your creation). You must then check that your masterpiece is
compatible with existing measures (or add new ones).


Add Functionalities
-------------------

More complicated. There are dozens of things left to do like
example, for those who wish, integrate an option
allowing the drawing of the seam allowances. I don't do it first by
choice — I trace them directly on the fabric after tracing the
pattern — but it happens to make writing quite a bit easier because
the margins are not a simple dilation of the finished pattern.
